# simpyDHT

This is a scholarly project as students in engineering school Polytech Annecy Chamb√©ry. The goal is to implement a distributed hash table (DHT) with a simulator (we chose SimPy). You can find our work in the repository (which is still in progress) and a report that presents the project's progress.

You can find the report by following <a href="./REPORT.md">this link</a>.
